# Augmented-Sudoku-Solver
Augmented Reality Sudoku SolverThis project is a combination of Computer Vision Concepts, CNN and Back Tracking Algorithm.  1. Computer vision is used to Isolate the sudoku from the entire frame and Transform it into a flat Square image. 2. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is used to detect the given digits in the sudoku and Load them into an array. The CNN architecture which is used is LeNet and Trained over 2000 images 3. The Backtracking algorithm is used to solve the Sudoku (array obtained from the CNN step) 4. Then the solved Sodoku Digits is projected on the image
